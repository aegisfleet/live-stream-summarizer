Features like a 'snap!' and a quick pinch instantly smoothing out wrinkles, acting as a 1-second iron, and the Nanofine processing that suppresses bacterial growth by over 99.9% were also explained. Shirogane Noel praised these features as being helpful for her 'sloppy' self.","timestamp":"00:19:58","type":"お知らせ"},{"title":"120-Day Return and Full Refund Guarantee","description":"The 120-day return and full refund guarantee offered by NELL was explained.

When the customer replied they had no appetite due to lack of sleep, she recommended the NELL Mattress.

You know, when I hold you like this, my feelings calm down so much. Your body temperature is warm, and listening to my heartbeat makes me feel at ease. Don't you feel the same way?
