As it was the first Monday of September, there were many instances where the timeline seemed to rewind to June or August in the comments with listeners, and Polka&#039;s interactions emphasizing that it was indeed September 1st were amusing. Especially memorable was the scene where Polka retorted, &quot;You must have gone to the past or the future,&quot; to a listener who claimed August didn&#039;t end on the 31st but continued into the 32nd and beyond. The stream was lively with a wide range of topics, including old Minecraft specifications, the topic of Tsukimi burgers, and mentions of listeners&#039; homework. Polka also talked about her own songs, discussing the struggles and joys of production, such as songs related to low atmospheric pressure, older songs, and behind-the-scenes stories from music video shoots. It was a consistently cheerful and bustling stream, filled with laughter.">
