The two sharpened their five senses (taste, hearing, sight, smell) and challenged themselves to identify products while handicapped (blindfolded, nose plugs). Correct answers resulted in discount coupons being distributed to viewers. Following successes in the first half, they tackled sight and smell quizzes in the second half. Although they failed the sight quiz, they got a &#039;Teetee Chance&#039; and tasted the reward salmon. They successfully identified the Japanese chestnut Mont Blanc in the smell quiz and also succeeded in the final food review mission, reviving the coupons for Nagasaki Kakuni Manju (braised pork bun) and salmon.
