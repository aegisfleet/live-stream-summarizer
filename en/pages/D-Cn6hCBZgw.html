After the announcement time at the beginning of the stream, she logs into the server but is confused because her initial spawn point is different from before and she possesses many unfamiliar items. She explores the world at her own pace, gathering resources like wood and coal, using Summer Park as her base. This time, she progresses through the game while engaging in a wide range of casual talk, especially discussing seasonal topics, TV program content restrictions, and sharing anecdotes about interacting with junior members. From the middle to the end of the stream, she spends time fishing in her self-made fishing pond and organizing the items she catches. While fishing, she obtains various fish, enchanted books, and nautilus shells, but is confused by enchantment combinations that don&#039;t work and the diversity of creatures that can be caught in the pond. In the latter half, she attempts to set up a concrete maker, which she had planned before, but faces ongoing trial and error, including gathering necessary materials and finding that the installation height is insufficient. Towards the end of this stream, while mentioning her own late-night habits, she digs even deeper to secure a new workspace in the underground area. Driven by her preference for white floors, she attempts to improve the concrete maker but encounters issues with block ejection and is seen re-evaluating the placement design. Throughout the stream, Tokino Sora&#039;s relaxed casual talk and gameplay continue.">

She says that Biby* rushes her greetings every time they meet, saying, \"I'm sorry! I'm late to greet you! I'm Biby! Do you understand!?\", which makes her instinctively say \"Huh?\".
