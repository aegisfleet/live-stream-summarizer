    <meta name="description" content="Kobo Kanaeru&#039;s &quot;Fond Memories&quot; is a music video where happy past memories and poignant present feelings intertwine. A woman recalls memories with a loved one, and their bond is depicted through letters, photos, and reunion scenes. However, scenes suggesting drifting apart and separation are gradually inserted, and at the end, a sense of desolation, as if letting go of memories, permeates. The warm yet melancholic melody and lyrics express complex emotions.">
