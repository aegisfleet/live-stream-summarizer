Pro mahjong player Takaharu Tai provides commentary, and frequent discussions about mahjong terminology occur among the members. In particular, casual talks about mahjong scoring patterns (yaku) become lively, with popular yakuman (limit hands) like Nine Gates (Chuuren Poutou) and All Terminals (Chinroutou) being discussed. Once the match starts, players engage in a fierce competition, featuring dramatic comebacks with ura-dora (bonus tiles), aggressive strategies, and defensive play. Towards the end, the dealer&#039;s consecutive turns (renchan) continue, and Yuraneko&#039;s powerful offensive shines, leading to an intense development with significant score changes. In the South round, Shibukawa&#039;s swift riichi (declared ready hand) and ippatsu (one-shot win) dominate, overwhelming other players. Throughout the match, professional mahjong commentary and the players&#039; excited reactions to the game situations are enjoyable. In the final South 4 round, Roboco expresses regret as she finishes in last place due to Shibukawa&#039;s high-scoring wins, including a baiman (double mangan).">
