Using a comical avatar resembling a full-body suit, she repeatedly dances with models of other Hololive members. As the practice progresses, she becomes exhausted, often making strange movements or collapsing. However, undeterred by cable issues, she restarts multiple times and ultimately dances to her limit. Throughout the stream, she discusses the fun and difficulty of VR dancing, the reality of physical exhaustion, and raises awareness about technical challenges in VR and heatstroke prevention, all while deepening interaction with viewers, announcing future stream schedules, and sharing her effort and sense of accomplishment.">
