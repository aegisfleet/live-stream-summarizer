It&#039;s a survival horror game where they collect treasures to earn money for spaceship repairs. Despite Shigure Ui&#039;s overly free actions as a first-time player and being surprised by sudden enemies, the three cooperate to progress through the game. Notably, they overcome unexpected incidents and fears, such as unique ideas like flushing enemies down the toilet, a shrinking phenomenon, and battles with giant gnomes.

Ultimately, they show persistence by clearing the mission even when everyone is defeated, leading to a moving ending where they repair the spaceship and embark on a new journey.">
