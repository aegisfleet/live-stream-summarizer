    <meta name="description" content="A stream where Hokaze Koshio, a VTuber belonging to Hololive, challenges a fear tolerance diagnostic test. While chatting with viewers, she takes on a game full of various scares. Inside the game, tests for three abilities—judgment, memory, and observation—are conducted to measure the player&#039;s tolerance to fear. Contrary to her cute character, the game is full of eerie BGM and sudden horror expressions. Despite being scared, she progresses through the game, occasionally showing a calm demeanor. In the latter half, she experiences multiple jump scares in a spooky corridor reminiscent of the Backrooms, screaming but still clearing it. Finally, the results of the fear tolerance diagnosis are announced, and she shows both surprise and satisfaction at the unexpected outcome: zero points in memory but a high rating for her courage.">
