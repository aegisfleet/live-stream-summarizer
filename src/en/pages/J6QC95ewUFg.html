Amusing stories were shared, such as losing her phone during the Harry Potter Studio Tour, Mio-chan&#039;s serious acting, and episodes with teachers from her school days. There was also a discussion about the retro boom and personal values, maintaining a friendly atmosphere throughout as Miko interacted with her viewers. The stream concluded with nostalgic topics, looking back at past broadcasts. The conversation shifted from generational theories to Chiikawa and Ichiran Ramen, finally culminating in her passionate talk about Chiikawa Cafe merchandise.">
