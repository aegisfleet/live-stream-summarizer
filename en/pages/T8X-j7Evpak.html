            highlights: [{"title":"Stream Start and Collaboration Greetings","description":"The collaboration stream between Ookami Mio and Shirakami Fubuki begins. The project is 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,' with Fubuki handling the manual and Mio in charge of defusing the bomb. The hidden goal for this stream is revealed: a quota of \"Unlocking an announcement upon clearing 6 modules.\"","timestamp":"00:02:35","type":"挨拶/企画説明"},{"title":"First Bomb: Tutorial Modules","description":"They attempt the first bomb, which has a 5-minute timer and three modules. They start with the Wire module, and following Fubuki's manual, they cut the bottom white wire out of three wires, successfully clearing it. Next, they attempt the Holding Button module, succeeding by matching the lamp color (yellow) with the last digit of the timer (4). Finally, they tackle the Keypad module, pressing the corresponding symbols in sequence, and successfully defuse the first bomb just barely.","timestamp":"00:06:48","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Second Bomb: Something Old, Something New (Success)","description":"They attempt the second bomb. Since there are no wires, they start with the Button module. The red \"Press\" button's lamp flashed white, so they released the button when the last digit of the timer was 1, clearing it. Next, they cleared the Keypad module by pressing the buttons in sequence. The final module was Simon Says; they memorized the sequence of flashing colors, determined which buttons to press based on the presence of a vowel in the serial number, and cleared it.","timestamp":"00:11:46","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Third Bomb: Stepping Up (Success)","description":"They attempt the third bomb. First, they handled the Wire module and cleared it. Next, on the Button module, they held the blue button; since the lamp color was yellow, they released it when the last digit of the timer was 5, clearing it. Finally, they attempted the Display Board module, determined the button to press based on the text displayed (\"Mottomo\") and the button correspondence chart, pressing \"Left\" to clear it.","timestamp":"00:16:55","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Fourth Bomb: High Base (Failure)","description":"They attempt the fourth bomb. No wires. The Button module was a yellow \"Abort\" button; since the lamp lit up blue when held, they released it when the last digit of the timer was 4, clearing it. Next, they identified the letters in the Password module and cleared it. On the final module, Simon Says, they proceeded without checking for vowels in the serial number, combined with memory errors in the flashing pattern, unfortunately leading to a time-out and explosion.","timestamp":"00:27:06","type":"ゲーム/失敗"},{"title":"Fifth Bomb: High Base (Failure)","description":"They retry the fourth bomb. In the Wire module, they cut the last wire as it was blue, clearing it. On the Button module (blue \"Detonate\" button), holding it caused a blue light, but the instruction to release when the timer ended in 4 led to failure. Furthermore, errors in determining the presence of vowels in the serial number in the \"Simon Says\" module, combined with memory errors of the button sequence, led to consecutive explosions. Fubuki apologized, acknowledging her mistakes as the manual handler.","timestamp":"00:31:06","type":"ゲーム/失敗"},{"title":"Sixth Bomb: High Base (Success)","description":"The third attempt at High Base difficulty. In the Wire module, since there were two yellow wires among the six, they cut the fourth wire from the top, clearing it. In Simon Says, they confirmed the presence of a vowel in the serial number and calmly processed the sequence of flashing colors, clearing it. For the final module, the Button module (blue \"Detonate\" button), they held it down, and since the lamp color was blue, they released it when the last digit of the timer was 1, clearing it. With this, they successfully cleared 6 modules and achieved the stream's quota.","timestamp":"00:37:33","type":"ゲーム/クリア"},{"title":"Challenge to the Difficult Module: Morse Code (Failure)","description":"To secure the 6-module clearance, they challenged the final difficult module: Morse Code. Mio attempted to read the \"ton-ton-tsu\" signals sent by Fubuki, but distinguishing between long and short signals proved difficult, ultimately resulting in a time-out and explosion.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"ゲーム/失敗"},{"title":"Morse Code Module Rule Confirmation","description":"After the explosion, Fubuki explained the rules of the Morse Code module (that the periodic signals correspond to words). With little time remaining, they resolve to aim for a clear on the next attempt.","timestamp":"00:42:01","type":"トーク/ルール解説"},{"title":"Final Bomb Defusal Attempt (Clear)","description":"They challenged the bomb again. They successfully defused the Morse Code module by tuning in and transmitting the specified frequency (3.532MHz). They then carefully cleared the subsequent Wire module and Simon Says, achieving the goal of clearing 6 modules.","timestamp":"00:43:26","type":"ゲーム/クリア"},{"title":"New Outfit Reveal Announcement Unlocked","description":"Following the achievement of the 6-module clearance quota, the long-awaited announcement was unlocked. It was announced that Shirakami Fubuki and Ookami Mio would reveal their matching new outfits in a relay format on their respective streams starting September 29th at 20:00 JST.","timestamp":"00:50:25","type":"お知らせ"},{"title":"Recruitment for New Outfit Prediction Project","description":"Silhouettes of the matching new outfits were released, and a project was announced inviting fans to submit fan art predicting the new outfits. Hints for the outfits were sought based on the silhouettes and the revealed background images.","timestamp":"00:52:05","type":"企画/募集"},{"title":"Detailed Schedule for the Reveal Stream","description":"The schedule for the reveal stream was explained (Mio: starting 20:00, Fubuki: starting 20:30), followed by a subsequent joint chat stream (Zatsudan) by Fubumio. They laughed about Mio's face, covered in soot, looking like Mario's mustache.","timestamp":"00:55:08","type":"トーク/スケジュール"}],
