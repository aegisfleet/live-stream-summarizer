Plushies of Hololive members are photographed in various Japanese summer landscapes (unmanned stations, train interiors, beaches, sunflower fields, fireworks festivals, aquariums, sea of clouds, mountain streams, shrines, etc.), and Natsuiro Matsuri comments on each photo. The stream is filled with beautiful Japanese summer scenery and the charm of Holofriends, as Matsuri expresses surprise, emotion, and laughter at the unique photos from viewers. This time, even more creative photos are introduced, and Matsuri shows emotional reactions to the storytelling, making the plushies seem alive, and situations that convey the bonds between members. Towards the end, there are scenes touching on the depth of fan activities, such as photo projects using plushies and members&#039; itasha (decorated bikes). It&#039;s a heartwarming stream full of summer memories.">
