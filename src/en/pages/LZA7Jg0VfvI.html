Following the previous session, she completed the requested RV renovation (interior customization, plumbing connection, and surface finishing) and achieved an S rank. She then attempted the Bus Cleaning Contest in Challenge Mode but only managed a B rank. In the middle section, she tackled a school bus conversion request (into an office specification) and the cleaning and furnishing of a heavily dilapidated RV. After completing the final RV conversion in this part, she began working on the next job: renovating a school bus (complete destruction and cleaning of the interior, and surface finishing). She also searched extensively for collectible items and attempted the now-traditional dangerous mountain road drive. Towards the end of the stream, an unexpected &quot;DOOM&quot;-style mini-game appeared. Battling motion sickness, she completed the cleaning and interior custom work on a new RV, achieved an S rank, and concluded the broadcast.">
