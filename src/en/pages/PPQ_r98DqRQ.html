            },
            highlights: [{"title":"Pre-stream Information and New Song MV Release","description":"Even before the stream began, the latest information was introduced, including Hakui Koyori's membership-exclusive wallpapers, Shorts series, ASMR voice packs, and official stamps. Additionally, the music video for \"Cyanaze,\" a track from her 1st album, was released, showcasing Hakui Koyori singing and dancing in a dark world.","timestamp":"00:05:10","type":"お知らせ/歌"},{"title":"Hololive Koshien 2025 News Begins","description":"The latest news for Hololive Koshien 2025 began, with Hakui Koyori giving the opening remarks. It was announced that this stream would provide detailed strategy information to help viewers enjoy the game more deeply.","timestamp":"00:05:10","type":"トーク"},{"title":"About Eikan Nine's \"Practice Efficiency\"","description":"An explanation was given about \"Practice Efficiency,\" a crucial element in Eikan Nine. It was specifically detailed that when practice efficiency increases, the experience points from the next selected card become 2x, 4x, or even 6x, and which actions (such as spectating, field maintenance, individual coaching) increase practice efficiency.","timestamp":"00:06:51","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"About Eikan Nine's \"Team Policy\"","description":"It was explained that team policies affect the appearance rate of progress icons and the conditions for special cards to appear. Specifically, for \"Batting Power Focus\" and \"Defense Focus\" policies, possessing certain equipment (Tee, Batting Machine, Dumbbells, Bench Press, Fungo Bat, Knocking Machine) was explained to be a condition for cards to appear.","timestamp":"00:11:26","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"About Eikan Nine's \"New Recruit Scouting\"","description":"It was explained that the new recruit scouting period is from November to February, and the number of students that can be scouted varies (2, 4, or 6) depending on the school's reputation (weak, decent, strong). A complex system was detailed where a higher reputation increases the success rate, but better academic performance decreases it. Furthermore, the club joining probability based on responses from scouted junior high students (Excellent 100%, Normal 60%, Poor 10%) was also explained. It was also mentioned that additional scouting is possible by using an item called \"New Recruit Resume.\"","timestamp":"00:13:58","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"About Eikan Nine's \"Tension Effects\"","description":"In addition to the basic effect that a player's abilities increase when their tension is high during a game and decrease when it's low, a unique effect was explained: negative traits disappear when in peak form, and positive traits disappear when in slumping form. Details were also shared, such as tension not affecting defensive abilities and a \"super pumped\" state increasing success rates by 20%.","timestamp":"00:20:26","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"About Eikan Nine's \"Intimidation\"","description":"An explanation was given about the special ability \"Intimidation\" in Eikan Nine. It was explained that the effects differ between pitchers and fielders: for pitchers, when appearing as the second pitcher or later, the opponent batter's contact and power are reduced by -20; for fielders, the opponent pitcher's ball speed is reduced by -2km/h, control by -10, and stamina consumption is increased by +15. It was especially emphasized that the fielder's intimidation is very powerful because it applies the same effects to regular batters.","timestamp":"00:26:46","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Each High School Enters 2nd Year! Genkaijou High Members Announced","description":"Each high school participating in Hololive Koshien 2025 entered its second year, and \"Genkaijou High\" was the first school to announce its members. Powerful members such as Matsuri-senpai (reincarnated pro), Nenechi, Moona, Cali, and Yancha were introduced, with detailed explanations of their ability stats, special abilities, and suitable positions.","timestamp":"00:31:43","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AHOY High Enters 2nd Year! Members Announced","description":"Next, \"AHOY High's\" second-year members were announced. A notable characteristic was the presence of many introverted players, such as Godkaira (Good Kaira), Iofi, Aniki, and Shylily. The pitching staff, in particular, featured many powerful players, whose ability stats and special abilities were introduced in detail. It was emphasized that ace Good Kaira is a talent with D-level control and stamina, possessing the special ability \"forkball.\"","timestamp":"00:35:32","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Konkoyo High Enters 2nd Year! Members Announced","description":"The second-year members of \"Konkoyo High,\" managed by Hakui Koyori, were announced. Unique members such as Raden-chan, Anima-chan, Kronii Onee-san, Rizu Onee-san, Sora-senpai, and Kronii Onee-san were introduced. Points of anticipation for future growth were discussed, including the strengthening of batting power with many \"Chasu C\" players, the absence of reincarnated pitchers, and the waiting for Kronii Onee-san's awakening.","timestamp":"00:38:26","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Ending","description":"An announcement was made regarding the end of the broadcast, concluding this Hololive Koshien 2025 News.","timestamp":"00:39:56","type":"エンディング"},{"title":"Konkoyo High's Strengths and Challenges in its 2nd Year","description":"Konkoyo High is a batting-power-focused team with an average contact of 50, but its pitching staff is weaker compared to other high schools, lacking an ace. It also carries negative traits like \"Tai Pinch F\" (poor performance in tight situations) and \"Slow Starter.\" Catcher A Lamy supports the pitching staff, and Noel has acquired \"Intimidation\" and is progressing in development. Attention is focused on whether they can perform as a batting-power-focused high school that can make up for runs given up.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Ousaki High's 2nd-Year Status and Key Players","description":"Ousaki High's challenges include not being able to recruit introverted players and a reincarnated pitcher having negative traits like \"Vs. Left F\" (poor against left-handed batters) and \"Wild Pitch.\" The new recruit gacha also resulted in a low roll, but Moco has high defensive ability and second base suitability, and Fuwawa has the potential to become stronger when near Moco. Hakotaro-senpai is expected to be good due to high running ability. Pitchers \"Hoshiya\" and \"Ohtani\" have strong positive traits as both fielders and pitchers, so how to utilize these players will be key.","timestamp":"00:41:26","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"2nd-Year New Recruit Star Comparison","description":"A comparison of the total star counts of each high school's new recruits showed Konkoyo High at the top with 1193 stars, but it was the only one that hadn't drawn any reincarnated players. Genkaijou High had Furukawa (1056 stars), AHOY High had Kawamura (920 stars), and Ousaki High had Nishidate (856 stars) join as reincarnated players. It was announced that mid-tier schools acquired new recruits with over 1000 stars, while schools with a decent reputation acquired around 900 stars.","timestamp":"00:44:11","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Summary of Each High School's 1st and 2nd Year Progress","description":"In the 1st year Summer Tournament, only Konkoyo High was eliminated in the first round. Other schools advanced to the best 4. In the 1st year Autumn Tournament, all schools failed to qualify for Koshien. In the 2nd year Summer Tournament, AHOY High decided to participate in Koshien. Genkaijou High and Ousaki High also qualified for the prefectural tournament. Konkoyo High is raising its reputation through volunteering and practice games, growing into a mid-tier school. AHOY High's qualification for Koshien, with its strong pitching staff, highlighted the importance of pitchers.","timestamp":"00:45:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Memorable Scene Recap: \"Is Hitting to Center Field Weak or Not?\"","description":"We watched a digest of Genkaijou High's game. In the bottom of the 5th, a come-from-behind 3-run homer was hit after wishing for one, but in the same inning, they were hit with consecutive hits and re-overtaken. In the 8th, \"MAMONO\" (demon power-up) activated, making the score 9-6. They overcame a 9th-inning bases-loaded jam to win 9-7. While many viewers expressed the opinion that \"hitting to center field is weak,\" a home run was hit to center field in this game. Although it was a retrospective outcome, it was explained that it's not necessarily weak, serving as an antithesis to the \"center-field return is weak\" notion.","timestamp":"00:46:58","type":"リアクション/ゲーム"},{"title":"Memorable Scene Recap: \"Home Run\"","description":"We looked back at a scene from Houshou Marine's stream where she aimed for a home run. While saying, \"If I aim for a home run, it never becomes a home run,\" she then hit a 3-run home run after thinking, \"It doesn't have to be a home run.\" Houshou Marine was deeply moved, exclaiming, \"My brain is burning~.\" From the sound of the hit, a mishearing of \"Bamiyan\" (a restaurant chain) was born, and it was exciting how it had the same intonation as \"home run.\" She commented that it was fun to watch her hit.","timestamp":"00:51:24","type":"リアクション/ゲーム"},{"title":"Memorable Scene Recap: \"Thus the Poppin-kyo Prospered\"","description":"We watched a training scene of Lamy. During a collaboration with Miokie-san, while executing the \"distract desire by changing the topic\" strategy, she continued training while discussing Popping Milky. As a result, her catcher rank rose from C to B, and then to A. Koyori, who dislikes mint, didn't believe it, but when it was revealed that Popping Milky is pink, \"Poppin-kyo\" was born. It was explained that training tends to fail when discussing unrelated topics, so discussing \"Poppin\" led to success, establishing \"Poppin-kyo\" as a behind-the-scenes setting for Holo Koshien.","timestamp":"00:53:15","type":"リアクション/ゲーム"},{"title":"Ousaki High's Scouting Strategy","description":"We watched the new recruit scouting process from Ousaki High's first winter to its second year. Nishidate had once declined scouting but was scouted again. It was recalled as a terrible scouting effort, and it was commented that a strategy of treating Holomem like touts was observed. It was stated that scouting strategies would need to change for future scouting efforts after the summer and autumn tournaments.","timestamp":"00:56:32","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Ending: Summary up to 2nd Year and Future Aspirations","description":"The progress of each high school up to their second year was reconfirmed, with an additional note that positive traits other than those at enrollment were added through development. Calling for support for Konkoyo High's upcoming development stream, this second installment of Hololive Koshien 2025 News concluded.","timestamp":"00:58:30","type":"エンディング"}],
