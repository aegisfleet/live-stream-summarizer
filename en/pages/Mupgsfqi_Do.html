At the Nagoya City Science Museum, she was deeply impressed by the abundance of hands-on exhibits, such as a 3D periodic table, cutting-edge science displays, metal fatigue experiments, and a tornado generator. In particular, she enjoyed the best astronomical observation experience in comfortable reclining seats at the optical planetarium, which recreates a starry sky close to reality. While expressing surprise at the sheer scale of the entire facility, she conveys how she enjoyed many exhibits and felt refreshed both mentally and physically.

            highlights: [{"title":"Stream Start and Opening Talk","description":"The stream begins with greetings to viewers and a discussion about the recent arrival of autumn. The conversation gets lively with behind-the-scenes stories from Usada Pekora's recent project, 'Watermelon Splitting with Rubber Bands Stream,' in which she participated.","timestamp":"00:02:22","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Announcing the Fluorite Mining Experience","description":"She reports to viewers that she went on a fluorite mining experience. She talks about the beauty of fluorite, which glows blue under a black light, and shows photos of the fluorite she mined.","timestamp":"00:12:35","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Mining Experience Participants and Itinerary","description":"She reveals that a total of 7 VTuber friends, including Juufuutei Raden, participated in the mining experience. The participants included Kahaku Haku, Hoshimi Madoka, Ruri, and Moroboshi Meguru. She mentions that they stayed overnight in Nagoya and then headed to Sasabora Fluorite Mine by train, enjoying the journey as if on a picnic.","timestamp":"00:14:45","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Charms and Surprising Facts of Sasabora Fluorite Mine","description":"She expresses surprise that the fluorite mine uses a repurposed abandoned school. She says the school is well-maintained, even having toilets with bidets. She reveals the participation fee for the mining experience is 5,000 yen per person and explains that it's a guided tour to find fluorite. She also shares trivia heard from the guide, such as how fluorite was used to lower the melting point during iron refining, and why mosquito larvae don't breed in clear streams.","timestamp":"00:19:37","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Mining Process and Muddy Experience","description":"She describes digging for fluorite with a shovel and a black light. She became covered in mud while eagerly searching for stones, eventually resorting to lying down to dig. She amusingly recounts how each participant dug for stones in their own unique way, saying they enjoyed it like children.","timestamp":"00:32:02","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Mined Fluorite and Processing Experience","description":"She reveals the rough fluorite stones she mined. She talks about the processing experience of polishing the fluorite washed in the mountains, and shows the beauty of the processed fluorite. Various shapes and colors of fluorite are introduced, and she expresses surprise at their diversity.","timestamp":"00:39:03","type":"トーク"},{"title":"The Fantastical 'Milky Way' Inside the Cave","description":"She describes moving deeper into the mine shaft, where turning off the lights and shining a black light revealed countless crushed fluorite pieces on the ground glowing blue, creating a scene like the Milky Way in space, which she shows with photos. She explains that these lights are tiny fragments of fluorite left behind by miners who worked there since the Showa 20s (1945-1954), conveying her deep impression at the fantastical sight.","timestamp":"00:40:43","type":"トーク"},{"title":"The Principle of Fluorite's Luminescence and Experiment Experience","description":"She explains that fluorite glows not only under black light but also with heat. She speculates on how miners in an era without black lights might have observed the glow of heat-luminescent fluorite. She excitedly mentions that during the mining tour, one can experience an experiment in the science room using an alcohol lamp to make fluorite glow with heat.","timestamp":"00:55:56","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Fluorite Mined by Everyone","description":"After the mining experience, she reveals a photo of buckets filled with fluorite mined by all participants. Each bucket had a caricature of a member, and she also shows her own bucket. She says that the fluorite brought home can be enjoyed by shining a black light on it.","timestamp":"01:00:27","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Happenings and Overnight Stay in Nagoya","description":"On the way back from the mining tour, they encountered a mishap where the Shinkansen stopped for about an hour. As a result, she says they gave up on returning to Tokyo and decided to stay another night in Nagoya. She shares an anecdote about how everyone overslept by two and a half hours the next morning and rushed to catch the Shinkansen.","timestamp":"01:06:29","type":"トーク"},{"title":"An Experience of Learning and Emotion at Nagoya City Science Museum","description":"She announces visiting the Nagoya City Science Museum. She recounts gaining knowledge and emotion through various exhibits and experiences, such as displays on the Earth's form, the periodic table, glowing moss, baby stalactites, and experiments with fluorite's thermal luminescence, all for an inexpensive admission fee of 400 yen for exhibits only, or 800 yen including the planetarium.","timestamp":"01:14:04","type":"トーク"},{"title":"New Project Idea: Painting with Fluorite","description":"Inspired by her learning at the Nagoya City Science Museum, she unveils a project idea: mixing crushed fluorite with animal glue (nikawa) to create paint and draw pictures that only glow when a black light is shined on them. She asks viewers if they are interested in this project, building anticipation.","timestamp":"01:18:24","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Hands-on Exhibits and Giant Telescopes at the Science Museum","description":"She talks about the hands-on exhibits at the Nagoya City Science Museum. She expresses surprise at the numerous exhibits, including a 3D periodic table, cutting-edge science displays, and various observation equipment (telescopes, microscopes). She mentions the abundance of hands-on exhibits like an experience to break metal by inducing metal fatigue and a tornado generator. She notes that the science museum spans from the 2nd basement floor to the 6th floor, with the planetarium and astronomical telescope in a separate building. She emphasizes that it's so comprehensive that one couldn't see everything even in a full day.","timestamp":"01:20:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Nagoya City Science Museum Planetarium Experience and Impression","description":"She talks about her planetarium experience at the Nagoya City Science Museum. She explains that it features a \"Universarium-something-or-other optical planetarium\" that can reproduce a starry sky close to reality, and that visitors can comfortably view it from individual reclining and rotating seats. She admits to falling asleep midway due to the extreme comfort and vows to try again. She expresses her profound impression of the realistic starry sky, the background music, and the narration.","timestamp":"01:43:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Other Attractions of the Science Museum and Announcements","description":"She mentions exhibits at the Nagoya City Science Museum that she couldn't experience due to time constraints, such as the 'Extreme Cold Lab (-30 degrees Celsius)' and the 'Discharge Lab (Tesla coil electric sparks)'. She expresses her impression of the wide variety of hands-on exhibits that adults can enjoy all day, including optical illusions and water cycle displays, and says she felt refreshed both mentally and physically. Finally, she announces the decision to release ReGLOSS's 2nd album 'Snapshot' and the decision to hold their 1st live concert 'Flash Point' on December 16th.","timestamp":"01:51:54","type":"トーク"}],
