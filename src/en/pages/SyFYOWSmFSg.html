            highlights: [{"title":"Opening Greetings and Settings Adjustment","description":"Kazama Iroha started her stream and greeted viewers. She adjusted the BGM, audio, and screen display settings, which were different from usual, based on comments from listeners. She mentioned that some screen movements were choppy, humorously comparing it to 'an old gal game,' but confirmed that her voice was fine.","timestamp":"00:02:04","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Explanation of Hiatus and New Outfit Postponement","description":"She explained the reason for the recent postponement of her new outfit reveal stream. She revealed that she received an urgent call about a dangerous condition involving a family member and rushed home to care for them. Since nursing duties alongside work were difficult, she coordinated with staff and her manager and decided to temporarily suspend streaming activities. She reported that her family member's condition has recovered and is now stable.","timestamp":"00:07:09","type":"お知らせ/トーク"},{"title":"Family Support and Gratitude","description":"She shared that in this incident, all of her family members showed understanding for her work and thanked her for her dedicated care. Through this experience, she seemingly reaffirmed the importance of human connections. She also shared anecdotes about interacting with busy Hololive members and reuniting with Choco-sensei and Fubuki-senpai.","timestamp":"00:11:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Future Streaming Activities and Environment Setup","description":"Regarding future streaming activities, she explained that game streaming would be possible once her internet environment is fully set up. While difficult with the current temporary setup, it is expected to improve within a few days. She also mentioned the possibility of increasing streams from the studio in the future and expressed her willingness to participate in the Minecraft test of courage. She thanked fans for their concerns and pledged to continue her activities without overexerting herself.","timestamp":"00:13:40","type":"お知らせ/トーク"},{"title":"MV 'Azukiiro' Release Announcement","description":"She hinted that the music video for her original song 'Azukiiro' will be released very soon. She humorously anticipated fan reactions, saying 'there's a chance you might collapse,' and urged them to prepare themselves.","timestamp":"00:40:20","type":"お知らせ/トーク"},{"title":"Minecraft Short Videos and Sustainable Activity Approach","description":"She explained that while she has a stock of recorded Minecraft short videos, she's behind on editing. She expressed gratitude for being able to work at her own pace thanks to fans' warm words, and stated her desire to download materials and undertake various projects once her internet environment improves.","timestamp":"00:41:40","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Super Chat Reading and Gratitude to Fans","description":"Apologizing for not being able to read Super Chat names due to poor connection, she reiterated her gratitude for the many Super Chats, 'welcome back' comments, and warm messages like 'please prioritize your family and your own mind and body first.' She conveyed that fans' words had also brought her a sense of relief.","timestamp":"00:42:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Thoughts on Original Song 'Azukiiro' and Expectations for the MV","description":"She reiterated that her original song 'Azukiiro' was truly a song she created herself, and that it is her favorite. With anticipation, she called on listeners to learn the song and sing and dance along at home once the MV is released.","timestamp":"00:42:50","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Participating in Minecraft Test of Courage and Outfit Dilemma","description":"She reported that her participation in the Minecraft test of courage is confirmed. She explained that other Hololive members and external VTubers will also participate, meaning she might appear on screen. She revealed her dilemma about what outfit to wear for the test of courage: a yukata or gym clothes. She discussed the conflict of gym clothes being practical for getting dirty, but not matching the summer festival atmosphere.","timestamp":"00:46:00","type":"お知らせ/トーク"},{"title":"'Gym Clothes' as Her Identity","description":"While worrying that she might be mistaken for an elementary school student if she wore gym clothes to a summer festival, she asserted that gym clothes are her 'identity.' She hinted at the possibility of wearing a yukata for streams but being a 'mischievous kid' playing in gym clothes off-stream, humorously telling listeners it would be easier to find her in her gym attire.","timestamp":"00:51:30","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Stream Ending Greetings and Thanks","description":"As she concluded the approximately one-hour stream, she expressed gratitude for the warm support and Super Chats from listeners. She apologized again for not being able to read all Super Chats due to poor connection and stated that she would review them later at her leisure. She promised to reunite in the next stream and concluded with 'Goodnight, bye-bye, see you again!'","timestamp":"00:56:50","type":"挨拶"}],
