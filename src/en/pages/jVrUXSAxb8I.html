She revealed that the outfit for Nene's new card was already decided, and the abilities would be brainstormed together with the viewers.","timestamp":"00:03:22","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Introduction of New Card Ability Candidates and Nene's Comments","description":"The program presented candidates for the new card's abilities ('Magamaga-zu,' 'NepoLabo,' 'Nekko,' 'Taotao Star (Gyoza),' 'Insects,' 'Others'). Nene explained each proposal and playfully commented on 'Taotao Star,' saying it was 'embarrassing, like Korin Star.'","timestamp":"00:05:15","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Discussion of Unique Ability Ideas from Viewers","description":"Viewers proposed unique ability ideas such as 'If it's an insect, Josef might be a better fit,' 'Everyone's Heart's Energy Drink,' and 'Cheerleading evokes a buff image.' Nene actively discussed these ideas with the viewers.","timestamp":"00:11:55","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Discussion of Powerful Abilities with Drawbacks","description":"The discussion delved into card ability ideas that were very powerful but came with drawbacks, such as 'Lose after 2 turns but powerful effect' and 'Too many copies lead to a debuff (cannot move for 1 turn).' Nene commented, 'I like the thrill,' pursuing both game balance and fun.","timestamp":"00:18:34","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Finalization of Ability Idea: Nene's Yell and 200 Attack Power","description":"From various ideas, the ability 'If NepoLabo is on the field with Nene's Yell, Nene's attack power becomes 200' was finally narrowed down. Nene commented with a smile, 'Is it too much?' while building anticipation for the ultimate card.","timestamp":"00:34:04","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Discussion of Ability Idea to Reveal Opponent's Hand","description":"Nene discussed an ability idea where, if an opponent draws a card during their turn, Nene would point out whether they are right-handed or left-handed, revealing their hand and granting Nene a buff. Viewers suggested that this could disadvantage players with a specific dominant hand, and also proposed abilities to make the opponent discard cards or reveal their hand.","timestamp":"00:40:08","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Discussion of Ability Idea to Increase Attack Power for All Holomem","description":"Nene proposed the concept of 'Everyone's Energy Drink' and discussed an ability idea where if Nene is on the field, the attack power of all Holomem, including the opponent's, would increase by 80. This unique effect was expected to always strengthen everyone in battles where Nene participates.","timestamp":"00:51:33","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Final Decision on Card Ability and Illustration Drawing","description":"Nene finalized the card ability as 'Everyone's Energy Drink: Attack power +40 for all Holomem on the field (including opponents), and if Nene becomes 2nd, an additional +60 for Nene.' After the decision, Nene decorated the card frame with pink hearts and ribbons and drew her signed illustration.","timestamp":"01:00:30","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Introduction of 5th Anniversary Full Set Merchandise","description":"Nene introduced her self-designed 5th-anniversary full-set merchandise. This included an acrylic card stand and card sleeves, Nenechi's Itabag, a Nekko plushie cap, one voice pack, a bonus original card, and a bonus voice. It was emphasized that the original card, created through this project, was the ultimate card and came with Nene's autograph.","timestamp":"01:09:11","type":"お知らせ"}],
