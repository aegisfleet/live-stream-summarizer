    <meta name="description" content="This is a highlight of a VRchat collaboration stream where Rin-do Chihaya, guest Bibi, and Su-chan visited &quot;Pokopy Land&quot; as a group of three. Viewers changed their VRchat avatars to slime-like characters and Peanut-kun to explore the park. In the early part of the stream, despite a mishap where Bibi&#039;s avatar behavior became unstable, they safely arrived at the entrance of Pokopy Land. The park was adorned with colorful decorations and cute characters, offering various attractions such as mini-games, cafes, and a haunted house. The three enjoyed Pokopy Land to the fullest, taking commemorative photos wearing Peanut-kun hats and eating hamburgers at a cafe. They also experienced horror-themed attractions, resulting in a lively stream full of surprises and laughter. This part of the stream focuses on clearing the &quot;Pi Gyaku Lab,&quot; riding the Gummy Coaster, visiting the public bath, Chanto Cho&#039;s Fortune-telling House, and the Ferris wheel, thoroughly enjoying Pokopy Land. Finally, they enjoyed the scenery of Pokopy Land, reflected on their fun memories, expressed their future desire to visit other worlds when they become 3D, and concluded by thanking the viewers and guests.">
