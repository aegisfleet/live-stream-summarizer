The stream depicted lively interactions among members who, despite being confused by the new map and new roles like the Shapeshifter, cooperated as crewmates to complete tasks and identify impostors. In this game, the impostor side was very active, with Matsuri, a Shapeshifter, attempting to hide by mimicking members who were chasing each other, and Riona Hibikisaki, as a Viper, successfully executing kills with her teammates. In the latter half of the game, various developments unfolded, such as Riona Hibikisaki making brilliant kills as an impostor and being mistakenly ejected as a crewmate.
