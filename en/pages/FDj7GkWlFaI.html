    <meta name="description" content="An impromptu chat stream by Yukihana Lamy. It began with an explanation for the sudden start, followed by her impressions of yesterday&#039;s Hololive all-member live concert, her desire to hold a solo live concert herself someday, and a wide range of ideas for real-life events such as dinner shows and outdoor barbecues. She interacted with viewers on various topics, including zombie movies and games, and how she spends her Obon holiday, deeply discussing Hololive members&#039; zombie resistance. In the latter half of the stream, daily topics like Lamy&#039;s unique way of eating fried eggs and a discussion about summer fruits livened things up. Announcements for her new song &#039;Yoppara Music&#039; and the introduction of 5th-anniversary merchandise were also made.
