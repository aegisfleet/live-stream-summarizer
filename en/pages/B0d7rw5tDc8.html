She started the stream with a unique greeting using a mini-character inside her mouth on the thumbnail, amusing viewers before diving into the main game. During the game, she was puzzled by the anomalies appearing one after another, but with her keen observational skills, she discovered many. She particularly showed a spirit of inquiry, noting the possibility that anomalies from the &#039;Exit 8&#039; movie might have been added to the game. In the latter half, even after clearing the game once, she continued searching for new anomalies, discovering many, such as the hallway changing to warm-colored light and the old man&#039;s face changing. She finally cleared the game by getting into a futon, achieving the mandatory one-hour stream. Overall, the stream was a pleasant experience, filled with Korone&#039;s enjoyable reactions, surprise, and laughter.">
