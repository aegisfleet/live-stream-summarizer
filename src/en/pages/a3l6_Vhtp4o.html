Nerissa&#039;s PC audio issues and game crashes provided laughs while the game progressed. Ultimately, everyone was eliminated and it was game over, but they showed enthusiasm for a retry. In the latter half&#039;s chat, topics like whether or not to eat kiwi skin and game bugs on Windows 11 were lively discussed. Various announcements were also made, including Advent&#039;s original songs, Nerissa&#039;s &#039;Father&#039;s&#039; debut stream, and Koseki Bijou&#039;s acoustic live. Finally, FUWAMOCO announced a continuous stream of &#039;Silent Hill F&#039; and expressed gratitude to the viewers, ending the stream on a lively note.">
