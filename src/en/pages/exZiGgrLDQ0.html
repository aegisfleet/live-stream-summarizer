In this mining simulation game, the four members work together to dig their way to the abyss at 1000m underground. They collect resources to upgrade their shovels, backpacks, and other tools, aiming to descend deeper efficiently. This time, after breaking through 500m underground, they unearthed large quantities of valuable ores like uranium and diamonds, and utilizing fast travel, they reached the final destination at 1000m underground. However, a mysterious facility stretched out before them, and a large red button awaited the members. Ultimately, Pekora, as the host, pressed the button, and together they &quot;exploded&quot; the underground world. They then returned to the surface, looked back on their journey, and concluded the stream happily.">
