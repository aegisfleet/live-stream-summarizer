Her subordinate Ishida's opinion was not consulted at all, increasing his anxiety.","timestamp":"00:00:10","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Cooking Begins for First Dish: 'Traffic Light'","description":"The first menu item uses bell peppers, kimchi, and mayonnaise. The process of slicing bell peppers in half lengthwise and removing the stem and seeds is shown.","timestamp":"00:00:32","type":"料理"},{"title":"First Dish 'Traffic Light' Completed","description":"The 'Traffic Light' is completed by stuffing a large amount of kimchi into halved bell peppers and sloppily drizzling mayonnaise on top. Its appearance is very simple.","timestamp":"00:01:12","type":"料理"},{"title":"First Dish 'Traffic Light' Tasting and Judgment","description":"Ishida tastes the 'Traffic Light,' made of raw bell peppers with kimchi and mayonnaise. He makes a pained expression with the raw crunching sound of the bell pepper, feeling nauseous. The judgment is a punitive 'X' because it tastes too bad.","timestamp":"00:02:29","type":"リアクション"},{"title":"Background and Naming of First Dish 'Traffic Light'","description":"La+ explains the background, stating she wanted to make stuffed bell peppers but forgot to buy other ingredients, so she coincidentally added kimchi and mayonnaise that were at home. She names it the unique 'Traffic Light'.","timestamp":"00:02:47","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Cooking Begins for Second Dish: 'Warm & Fuzzy Set'","description":"Oatmeal and soup base appear as ingredients for the second dish. La+ explains that she 'excavated' them because there was nothing to eat in the refrigerator.","timestamp":"00:03:48","type":"料理"},{"title":"Second Dish 'Warm & Fuzzy Set' Completed","description":"The 'Warm & Fuzzy Set' is completed simply by putting oatmeal and soup base into a container, adding water by eye, and heating it in the microwave.","timestamp":"00:05:14","type":"料理"},{"title":"Second Dish 'Warm & Fuzzy Set' Tasting and Reaction","description":"The appearance of the warmed oatmeal worsens when stirred. Ishida screams, 'What is this? It looks completely unappetizing!' and 'It looks like trash!'

The judgment is a neutral '△' (neither good nor bad). He honestly states that it's more edible than the Traffic Light, but he doesn't want to eat it again.","timestamp":"00:07:13","type":"リアクション"},{"title":"Cooking Begins for Third Dish: 'Fruit Mix Ice'","description":"Frozen fruits (berries, mango, pineapple) are introduced as a dessert to eat when it's hot. A simple recipe is shown, which involves mixing these together and drizzling honey on top.","timestamp":"00:08:04","type":"料理"},{"title":"Third Dish 'Fruit Mix Ice' Tasting and Reaction","description":"Ishida, who has sensitive teeth, takes a bite and groans from the extreme cold. He screams 'So cold!' and laments that while it looks better, it tastes no different from plain ice.","timestamp":"00:09:31","type":"リアクション"},{"title":"Third Dish 'Fruit Mix Ice' Judgment","description":"Despite struggling with the cold, it receives a '△' judgment, being better than the Traffic Light. While it has sweetness from the honey, Ishida retorts to the health-conscious La+, saying, 'Drizzling honey is being overly clever!'","timestamp":"00:00:25","type":"リアクション"},{"title":"Theme and Conclusion of Extreme Meals","description":"La+ states that the theme of Extreme Meals is 'how healthily and easily can one cook,' but Ishida tells her to 'abandon health consciousness' and concludes by suggesting they go eat a delicious meal after the filming.","timestamp":"00:10:47","type":"トーク"}],
