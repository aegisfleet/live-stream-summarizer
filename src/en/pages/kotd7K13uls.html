    <meta name="description" content="A livestream by Todoroki Hajime of hololive ReGLOSS playing the horror game &quot;Fear Resistance Diagnostic Test,&quot; which diagnoses fear tolerance. The stream started with baseline measurements of judgment, memory, and observation skills in relation to fear, while interacting with viewers. In the first half, she tackled Test 1, dealing with sudden surprises (jumpscares), and Test 2, dealing with the fear of hiding (stealth elements). In Test 2, she explored an environment requiring attention to sound and sight but eventually lost sanity and failed. She ultimately cleared Test 3, concluding the tests with a result showing strong resistance to jumpscares but low tolerance for the fear of being chased. The latter part of the stream focused on free talk, discussing her health, future streams, and a lively discussion about casting roles in Harry Potter. Throughout the stream, she approached the game&#039;s concept seriously but provided comical reactions to the horror elements, resulting in an energetic broadcast.">
