Encountering new anomalies such as a smiling old man, an old man whose face is melting, a giant old man, and stains on the wall, Polka shows various reactions. She cleared all anomalies and reached the ending, immersed in the emotion of completing the game, expressing explosive joy at clearing it after two years. Additionally, the game&#039;s ending sequence and the playful bonus part, where she wears Watame&#039;s sunglasses and miniaturizes her own model, were designed to entertain viewers until the very end, making it a highly satisfying stream.">
