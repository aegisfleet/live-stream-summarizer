Thank you.'","timestamp":"01:50:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Final Report from ChatGPT","description":"A detailed S&M diagnosis report from ChatGPT, based on 50 answers, is released. Her S-degree (desire to dominate) is 32/100, M-degree (desire to be submissive) is 81/100, and Switch-degree (ability to switch between S/M depending on the situation) is 58/100. Ririka Ichijo is surprised but satisfied with these results, showing particular excitement over her high M-degree. The attribute mapping identifies her as 'Shyness-based M,' 'Dominated-type M (strongest),' 'Reversal M (enjoys role reversal, quite strong),' among others. It is revealed that she is a trust-dependent M, with 'being lied to' as an absolute condition she dislikes the most. The report also details scenarios that excite her, those that don't suit her, compatible play styles, and niche, interesting discovery points. Notably, 'liking to be teased by younger people' is listed as a niche attribute, which Ririka Ichijo vehemently denies ('Ririka is not like that!'), while seemingly finding it amusing. Ultimately, ChatGPT suggests converting the report to a PDF, which Ririka Ichijo accepts.","timestamp":"01:53:43","type":"リアクション"}],
