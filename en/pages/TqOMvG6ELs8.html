    <meta name="description" content="Minecraft stream by Hibisaki Riona. She had planned to continue building the SUMMER HOUSE at Holo Server Summer Park, but a series of unexpected incidents occurred: first, a large number of camels went on a rampage, followed by pigs escaping from the aquarium and scattering across the world. She attempted to repair the aquarium to contain the pigs and tackle a puzzle mission, but faced continuous challenges. Especially in the latter half, the mass spawning of even more pigs became unmanageable, yet Hibisaki Riona remained impressive, working positively despite her confusion and enjoying interactions with her viewers. In the aquarium&#039;s puzzle mission, she deciphered instructions to feed pigs and tried adjusting lighting and setting up Redstone circuits. Towards the end, she decoded hidden instructions from Mr. M, completed a complex mechanism to guide pigs into a specific waterway, and finally discovered Mr. M&#039;s room, completing the mission. This stream saw the completion of the water slide and the aquarium, marking steady progress.">
