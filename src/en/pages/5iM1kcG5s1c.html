            },
            highlights: [{"title":"Starting with Stream Troubles","description":"She apologized for the stream delay, explaining that her monitor wouldn't display due to PC static discharge. She mentioned that she had been trying not to shut down her PC before Ohasuba recently, but decided to power it off the previous night, which caused the trouble. After figuring out the cause, she apologized to viewers with a laugh.","timestamp":"00:01:34","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Funny Episode at Ichiran","description":"She shared an episode of going to Ichiran with several Hololive JP members and Bijou. Seeing Bijou nervous for her first Ichiran experience, Subaru amusingly taught her the rules of Ichiran, which made Bijou a bit scared. She also mentioned Bijou talking about Ichiran's popularity overseas and how everyone felt happy after eating ramen.","timestamp":"00:07:46","type":"トーク"},{"title":"La+ Darknesss's Catchphrases and Manager","description":"She talked about how hilarious it is that La+ Darknesss always uses specific catchphrases (like 'de gozaru!' and 'desu na!') with a pointing gesture, and shared an episode where her manager ended up picking up those catchphrases and struggling with it. She recounted how the manager consulted her, saying, 'Actually, I've caught that way of speaking and I'm having trouble!', and laughed while describing the various hardships La+ Darknesss's manager goes through.","timestamp":"00:29:36","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Watame's Souvenir Sense","description":"She talked about how Watame always brings interesting and funny souvenirs. This time, she received a duck-shaped pen and showed a photo, explaining that the duck part is detachable and its head comes off, but she was told it's cute and to use it. Laughing at Watame's unique sense, she said she's always happy to use them.","timestamp":"00:34:56","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Kanade's New Outfit Secret Story","description":"An behind-the-scenes story about Kanade's new outfit. When Kanade mentioned receiving hints for her new outfit from staff, Subaru asked, 'Who gave you the hints?', to which Kanade replied, 'Subaru-senpai's former manager!' Subaru recounted how she let out a loud scream in surprise. She quipped, 'Why does my former manager know everyone's business?!', concluding the episode with a laugh.","timestamp":"00:39:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Love Me! Dance Data Release Announcement","description":"Following Kanade's new outfit episode, Subaru talked about her surprise that her former manager also knows about other Holomems' new outfits. She then announced that the dance motion data for her new song \"Love Me!\" has been released and can be downloaded from the description, encouraging everyone to dance to it. She also urged the need for warm-up exercises due to the intense dancing.","timestamp":"00:40:14","type":"お知らせ"},{"title":"Tamagotchi Gene Inheritance Episode","description":"She talked about how genes are inherited through the Tamagotchi's 'Tsuushin' (communication) feature. She had named Okayu's Tamagotchi 'Kumitchi' because its face was so stern, like something out of \"Yakuza.\" However, after breeding it with Rui's Tamagotchi, the child inherited Rui's cute eye genes, and it was no longer Kumitchi. She uniquely expressed that genes are circulating among the Holomems.","timestamp":"00:42:40","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Nekomata Okayu's Home Cooking Episode","description":"She shared an episode where Nekomata Okayu made Udon and salad for Subaru. When Subaru mentioned wanting to go to Ichiran but not being very hungry, Okayu apparently cooked for her. Okayu seems to have been into cooking lately, and Subaru also showed off some delicious-looking food photos.","timestamp":"00:54:25","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Yukihana Lamy's Hardworking Side","description":"She talked about how Yukihana Lamy was so nervous before live rehearsals that she couldn't sleep. Subaru described Lamy as a hardworking and agile person, a cute girl who, even if she acts selfishly, will eventually do what's asked, and said she felt like protecting her.","timestamp":"00:57:50","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Among Us Collaboration Project with Holomems and Discussion about Inept Members","description":"She talked about having an Among Us collaboration stream with Holomems next week and being unsure whom to choose. She listed members who are bad at Among Us, such as Miko, La+ Darknesss, Mio, and Roboco, while praising Ayame as skilled. She shared an episode where she pretends to read a script when suspected in Among Us, but it's always obvious, and concluded by saying she's looking for members who can have this level of discussion.","timestamp":"01:00:20","type":"トーク"}],
