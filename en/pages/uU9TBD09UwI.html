            highlights: [{"title":"Stream Start and Game Overview Explanation","description":"The stream begins with Fubuki-san greeting her viewers. She explains that she will be continuing '66 Confessions of Sunpinel Castle,' specifically the '28 Confessions' part. She reviews the game's background, objective, and previous progress, re-explaining the 'anomalous beings' and 'strange phenomena' that the player must find. The game screen displays records of anomalies collected up to the previous session, presenting the characters, their tragic stories, and mysteries surrounding the player's own identity.","timestamp":"00:03:24","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the First Person, First Choice","description":"The game starts, and Fubuki-san explores the old castle. Faced with a person at the altar, she is forced to make her first choice: determine whether a strange phenomenon is occurring or not. She scrutinizes every element around her—the floor, walls, ceiling, furniture—but finds nothing particularly suspicious. Therefore, Fubuki-san chooses to 'ring the bell.' The result is correct, revealing that the first person was not an anomalous being.","timestamp":"00:06:07","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Second Person, Anomaly Occurs","description":"Fubuki-san confronts the second person. Again, she carefully observes her surroundings. This time, however, she discovers a clear difference: an 'eye-patterned gun,' which shouldn't have been there, is placed on the altar table. She chooses to 'shoot with the gun.' She successfully identifies the anomalous being.","timestamp":"00:09:50","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Third Person, Anomaly Again","description":"Encountering the third person. Fubuki-san meticulously checks her surroundings and discovers an 'eye-patterned gun' beside the altar table. As before, she chooses to 'shoot with the gun' and defeats the anomalous being.","timestamp":"00:12:33","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Fourth Person, New Anomaly","description":"Encountering the fourth person. She confirms there is no gun on the table, and this time, for the first time, she discovers 'bloodstains' spread across the floor. Red clothes are scattered on the bloodstains, and Fubuki-san chooses to 'shoot with the gun.' This was also correct, as she successfully identified the anomalous being and the strange phenomenon.","timestamp":"00:15:14","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Fifth Person, Bloodstains Again","description":"Fubuki-san confronts the fifth person. This time, she notices the anomaly of numerous 'bloodstains' scattered around the person at the altar. Based on her previous experience, she chooses to 'shoot with the gun.' This decision also proves correct, and Fubuki-san continues to eliminate anomalous beings one after another.","timestamp":"00:17:44","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Sixth Person, Monochrome World","description":"Encountering the sixth person. This time, the anomaly is that the stained glass at the altar has lost its color and become monochrome. Fubuki-san judges this to be a strange phenomenon and chooses to 'shoot with the gun.' This also succeeds, and she repels the anomalous being.","timestamp":"00:21:10","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Encountering the Seventh Person, Unexpected Development","description":"Fubuki-san confronts the seventh person. This time, the anomaly is that the stained glass, which should have been colorful, has become entirely 'monochrome.' Fubuki-san unhesitatingly chooses to 'shoot with the gun' and repels the anomalous being.","timestamp":"00:22:52","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game Clear and Truth Revealed","description":"After shooting the seventh anomalous being, the game is cleared. Fubuki-san wakes up in a hospital bed and is informed by a mysterious man that the exorcism was successful. It is revealed that the player, an exorcist, maintained sanity by taking medication and fought against ghosts. Furthermore, it is revealed that the mastermind behind this incident was a woman named Juliet, who killed many of her relatives in a dispute over her inheritance, and their grudges remained as ghosts in the old castle. Fubuki-san checks the list of people she has exorcised so far, learns that Juliet was the eldest daughter of the Harmonica family, and that many relatives met tragic ends. She then confirms that Juliet's name has been added to the list of exorcised people and prepares for a new exorcism.","timestamp":"00:24:48","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Noticing Anomalies in the Clock and Torches","description":"Resuming the exorcism, Fubuki-san checks for anomalies. She notices that the hands of the clock on the wall behind the altar are spinning at an unusually fast rate. She also realizes that the torches on both sides of the entrance door are brighter than before.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"First Person (Clock and Torches)","description":"Fubuki-san stands before the person at the altar and notices the anomaly of having four torches. There is also the anomaly of the clock hands spinning at an abnormal speed. She judges these to be strange phenomena and fires the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Second Person (Statue Stirring)","description":"Moving to the next room, Fubuki-san notices a statue standing on a pillar stirring. It changes position as soon as she looks away, leaving no room for error. Fubuki-san judges the statue's movement to be a strange phenomenon and shoots it with the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"00:42:18","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Third Person (Hand Appears)","description":"Moving to the third person's room, a gigantic bloody hand appears from the altar door. Fubuki-san notices this anomaly and shoots it with the gun. However, this was incorrect, leading to a game over.","timestamp":"00:45:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Fourth Person (Woman's Gaze Moves)","description":"A portrait of a woman displayed on the room's wall moves her gaze to follow Fubuki-san. Fubuki-san judges this to be a strange phenomenon and shoots with the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"00:58:24","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Fifth Person (Transparent Chair)","description":"Upon entering the room, Fubuki-san notices the anomaly of a transparent chair. She judges this to be a strange phenomenon and shoots with the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"01:03:28","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Sixth Person (Torch Flickering)","description":"Upon entering the room, she notices that the torch installed on the wall is flickering. She judges this anomaly to be a strange phenomenon and shoots with the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"01:08:44","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Seventh Person (Book Floating)","description":"Upon entering the room, she notices a book floating on the altar table. Fubuki-san judges this anomaly to be a strange phenomenon and shoots with the gun. The result was correct.","timestamp":"01:13:13","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game Clear and New Information","description":"After exorcising all seven ghosts, the game is cleared. Fubuki-san wakes up again in a hospital bed and receives new information about 'Madeleine' from the doctor. It is revealed that Madeleine was a servant of the Harmonica family and a 'seer.' She sensed the presence of ghosts in the castle, and with the early deaths of the Eric couple and their descendant, the younger brother, who also died young, she felt that their grudges remained and wished for the ghosts to be freed. Fubuki-san is told by the doctor that 'the exorcism is almost complete' and prepares for the next one.","timestamp":"01:18:20","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Fourth Person (Anomaly of Still Candle Flame)","description":"Encountering the fourth person in '00 Confessions.' Fubuki-san discovers the anomaly of a candle flame on the altar table being still. She judges this to be a strange phenomenon, chooses to 'shoot with the gun,' and defeats the anomalous being.","timestamp":"01:27:27","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Fifth Person (Anomaly of Torn Carpet)","description":"Encountering the fifth person in '00 Confessions.' Fubuki-san notices that the carpet leading to the center of the altar is unnaturally torn. She judges this to be a strange phenomenon, chooses to 'shoot with the gun,' and defeats the anomalous being.","timestamp":"01:31:51","type":"ゲーム"}],
