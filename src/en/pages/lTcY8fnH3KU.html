            highlights: [{"title":"Stream Start & Participating Member Introduction","description":"The stream started from the Among Us 3D lobby following the MV for Nene's original song \"Kararaka!\". Nene herself described the group as \"a bunch of super PONS mixed with one genius.\" The participating members (Miko, La+, Akirose, Mio, Polka, Luna, Watame, and Nene herself) introduced themselves sequentially.","timestamp":"00:03:09","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Self-Deprecating Introductions of the Overly Pon Members","description":"Each member shared their own 'Pon' episodes. Mikochi claimed she hadn't improved despite having played Among Us for a long time. Akirose admitted she was bad at social deduction games, Luna struggled with \"killing people,\" and Polka's past mysterious actions during streams were brought up as jokes.","timestamp":"00:04:24","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Special Rule Explanation: Forgiven Because They Are Pon","description":"Nene announced special rules just for this session: Since the players are Pon, everyone must watch kindly no matter what happens. During ejection discussions, any flimsy reason is acceptable, provided they explicitly state the name and the reason during the discussion.","timestamp":"00:10:07","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Game 1 Starts & Immediate Emergency Meeting","description":"Game 1 begins. Immediately after Crewmate Nene started a task, Luna pressed the Emergency Meeting button. Confusion erupted as it was a simple emergency call, not a body report. Since no one had a suspicious reason, everyone skipped the vote.","timestamp":"00:13:14","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"First Victim, La+ Darknesss, is Found","description":"The body of Lapsama (Purple) is reported, leading to another meeting. The discussion descended into chaos, with Watame (Yellow) suspecting Luna (White), and Nene suspecting Watame. As a result, Akirose (Green) was ejected, but she was a Crewmate.","timestamp":"00:16:18","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Impostor Polka is Ejected in Game 2!","description":"Mikochi's (Pink) body is reported, leading to a meeting. Nene pointed out Polka's (Brown) suspicious behavior, leading to Polka's ejection. Polka was an Impostor, giving Nene excellent intuition and putting the Crewmates at an advantage.","timestamp":"00:18:05","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Ejection Drama of the Overly Pon Crewmates","description":"Luna's (White) body is reported, leading to a meeting. Nene suspected Watame (Yellow) for being quiet in the previous discussion and had her ejected. However, Watame was also a Crewmate, leaving Nene dismayed. In the subsequent meeting, SB (Red) was also ejected, who was also a Crewmate.","timestamp":"00:20:13","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 3: Nene's Tragedy","description":"Mio's (Black) body is reported. The situation narrows down to Crewmate Nene and one remaining Impostor. Nene argued that Mio's muting was unnatural and had Mio ejected. However, Mio was a Crewmate, and Nene was subsequently killed by the remaining Impostor (Elite Mikochi), resulting in an Impostor victory.","timestamp":"00:34:44","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Setting Change (Discussion Time Adjustment)","description":"Since the games were ending too quickly, the discussion time was changed, extending it by six times. They decided to cool down temporarily to avoid confusion.","timestamp":"00:38:43","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Crewmates Annihilated, Defeat via Reactor Meltdown","description":"The Impostors (Polka/Mio) initiated a Sabotage (Reactor Meltdown), which the Crewmates failed to repair in time, resulting in a game over. The Impostors won because the reactor repair tasks were far away and many Crewmates didn't understand the rules.","timestamp":"00:40:30","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Analysis of Defeat and Chaotic Lobby","description":"After the defeat, Nene explained the mechanism of sabotage (failure to repair in time leads to defeat). However, the lobby remained chaotic, with Crewmates raising and lowering their hands, and Akisenthal attempting to abandon the ship.","timestamp":"00:40:50","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Game 2 Starts: LAPSAMA Becomes the Victim","description":"While Nene was completing tasks as a Crewmate, LAPSAMA's (Purple) body was reported. Akisenthal and Watame were nearby, but Watame denied any suspicious interaction with Akisenthal. The discussion failed to connect, resulting in Akisenthal's ejection, who was a Crewmate.","timestamp":"00:45:51","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Nene and Others Repair Oxygen Sabotage Just in Time","description":"The Impostors activated the Oxygen Depletion sabotage. While Crewmates were scattered, Nene was at Admin, and SB (Red) and Luna (White) repaired the navigation consoles, succeeding just before the time limit expired.","timestamp":"00:49:13","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Nene is Killed, Miko/SB Confirmed as Impostors","description":"Nene is killed by Red (SB) in Navigation. Switching to Ghost perspective, it is revealed that the Impostors are Elite Mikochi (Pink) and SB (Red). Watame pressed the emergency button, but the discussion went off track.","timestamp":"00:51:39","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Crewmates Eject Mikochi and Win","description":"Following the discussion, Elite Mikochi (Pink) was ejected and revealed to be an Impostor. Subsequently, the remaining Impostor, SB (Red), was also ejected, leading to a Crewmate victory. The members celebrated their first win wildly.","timestamp":"00:57:37","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 3 Starts: Nene is Killed Early On","description":"Nene is a Crewmate again. She is killed by Miko (Pink) very early on. LAPSAMA finds the body and calls an emergency meeting. Miko’s movements, who killed Nene, seem suspicious, but Nene’s testimony paradoxically clears Miko. Luna (White) is ejected, but she was a Crewmate.","timestamp":"01:00:48","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Crewmates Also Win Game 3","description":"Although the Impostors activated the Reactor Sabotage, the Crewmates responded quickly this time. After discussion, Miko and SB were ejected back-to-back, securing the Crewmates their second consecutive victory.","timestamp":"01:05:47","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 4 Starts: Akisenthal is Mistakenly Ejected","description":"Miko’s body is reported, but since no one was present at the scene, the discussion was confused. Akisenthal was ejected, who was yet again a Crewmate. Nene insisted, \"If you ask me, Akirose-senpai wasn't suspicious.\"","timestamp":"01:10:48","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Impostor Victory via Sabotage","description":"Mistaken ejections of Crewmates continued, favoring the Impostors (Elite Mikochi/SB). The Reactor Sabotage was activated, and the Crewmates failed to repair it, resulting in an Impostor victory.","timestamp":"01:15:56","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 5 Starts: Watame Mistakenly Triggers Emergency Meeting","description":"Nene started tasks as a Crewmate. Watame accidentally hit the emergency meeting button. Watame declared she would \"take it seriously,\" but her \"Pon\" nature persisted.","timestamp":"01:17:48","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 5: No One Ejected, Defeat via Sabotage","description":"Mikochi’s body is reported. No one could identify the Impostor in the meeting, and they skipped. Nene was then killed while repairing the lights. Impostors La+ and Hime activated the Reactor Sabotage, and the Crewmates failed to respond, resulting in defeat.","timestamp":"01:20:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game 6: Sabotage Defeat Following Accidental Emergency Button Press","description":"Immediately after the game started, Watame accidentally hit the emergency button, leading to a meeting, but they skipped. Afterwards, La+ was killed, and Oxygen Sabotage was activated. The Crewmates failed to repair in time, resulting in an Impostor victory (Mio/Akirose).","timestamp":"01:27:10","type":"game"},{"title":"Game 7: Mistakenly Ejecting Watame, Another Sabotage Defeat","description":"After Polka was killed, Watame was suspected in the meeting and ejected, but she was a Crewmate. Immediately after, the Reactor Meltdown Sabotage was activated, and repairs failed. The Impostors (Akirose/Mio) won, continuing the chain of Pon failures.","timestamp":"01:32:00","type":"game"},{"title":"Game 8: Impostor Victory Following Consecutive Mistaken Crewmate Ejections","description":"La+ and Red (SB) were ejected back-to-back during the meeting, but both were Crewmates. The Crew population dropped too low, ultimately resulting in an Impostor victory (Mikochi/Hime).","timestamp":"01:36:18","type":"game"},{"title":"Introducing Tag (Infected) Mode","description":"Since the Impostors were too strong, they changed the rules to try \"Infected Mode\" (Tag). The Infected quickly converted Crewmates one after another, leading to an extremely swift victory for the Infected team.","timestamp":"01:40:50","type":"game"},{"title":"Returning to Standard Play After Two Consecutive Tag Mode Defeats","description":"Since they were instantly defeated in Tag Mode as well, they returned to standard play. The Crewmates continued to fail to identify the Impostors, leading to ongoing defeats via failed sabotages.","timestamp":"01:44:30","type":"game"},{"title":"Crewmates Achieve Major Comeback Victory by Completing All Tasks!","description":"Late stage of the game. Although Nene was killed, the remaining Crewmates calmly proceeded with tasks and secured a victory via task completion without ejecting the Impostors. Everyone was overjoyed and shared their excitement.","timestamp":"01:56:20","type":"game"},{"title":"Final Match: Chaos Erupts as La+ is Revealed to be the Impostor","description":"A review of the final match.

However, the Crewmates managed to complete their tasks and secure a victory.","timestamp":"02:00:27","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Infected Mode Settings Adjustment","description":"In the lobby, they discussed balancing Infected Mode.
