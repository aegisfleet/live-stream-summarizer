    <meta name="description" content="The approximately 80-minute stream featured the streamer, Kogane Hishouko, chatting about her morning routine. It began with her expressing surprise at youth culture, such as the price of Swedish candy and the popularity of &#039;Labubu&#039; on TikTok, then touched on generational gaps by sharing nostalgic memories from her time working at a dagashiya (traditional Japanese candy store). Particularly memorable was the &#039;Bishobisho Experience&#039; episode, where her hands get soaked with sweat due to nervousness before live performances or work. This topic generated the buzzword &#039;bibibishobisho&#039; from an anecdote during a handshake event with listeners, eliciting empathy and laughter. She also shared tragic stories, such as wearing transparent boots on a rainy day, and waiting at work after forgetting her house keys, revealing her clumsy side. This stream revisited funny past episodes, like &#039;the wild experience of eating with her bare hands&#039; and &#039;unique interactions with other Hololive members (Holomem)&#039;, creating excitement with her listeners. The stream progressed in a warm atmosphere, as she humorously recounted her experiences, bridging the gap with her audience.">
