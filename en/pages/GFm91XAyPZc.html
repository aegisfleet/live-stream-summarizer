    <meta name="description" content="Koshika Riona of Hololive DEV_IS held a relaxed chat stream while fishing in Minecraft with her viewers. She covered a wide range of topics with lighthearted conversation, including her recent post-recording massage experience, beauty routine, overcoming her dislike of presentations in school, utilizing ChatGPT, favorite foods, and saunas. She also delved into travel plans with her fellow member Nico, a debate about favorite McDonald&#039;s menu items, and her multifaceted hobbies (beatmaking, electrical engineering, anime, games, etc.). Amusing stories from her student days, such as commuting on rainy days and being nicknamed &#039;Salt Fried Chicken Ramen Senpai,&#039; were also shared. She livened up the stream with Anpanman and Pokémon impersonations, but surprised listeners by revealing that her manager had instructed her to stop the impersonations mid-stream. Towards the end, she discussed fatigue from overusing her voice, her motivation to tackle accumulated housework, and meals at the studio (especially a delicious almond tofu gift). The stream concluded in a peaceful atmosphere with gratitude to her viewers and a promise to continue delivering healing.">
