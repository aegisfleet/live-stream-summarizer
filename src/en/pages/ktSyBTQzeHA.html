Kanade, who gets easily motion-sick and declared she would &#039;finish it in an instant,&#039; was immediately bewildered by numerous visual anomalies from the start of the game. She successively discovered various anomalies, such as unnatural changes in corridor posters, abnormalities in an old man&#039;s appearance and movement, and sudden changes in the path&#039;s brightness.
