    <title>Would You Rather? | Community Questions with @VestiaZeta - Holo-Summaries</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a collaborative stream where VTuber Shiori and guest Vestia Zeta answer &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; questions from viewers. They appeared in cute cat-ear hoodies, starting the stream in a relaxed atmosphere. Beginning with a question about whether they&#039;d prefer their house to be tidied without permission or to do a different job every day, the discussion became lively with serious pondering and jokes. They exchanged unique opinions on a variety of questions, ranging from deep themes like game difficulty and what kind of work they&#039;d create if they became creators, to philosophical inquiries about life choices and body swapping. Throughout, there was light-hearted and fun talk filled with laughter. In the latter half, unique questions continued, such as choosing between unlimited flight tickets or food tickets, a conversation about resin products with embedded cockroaches, and whether they&#039;d choose to speak only in whispers or shouts, which drew more laughter. The final question, about whether to do each other&#039;s makeup or cook for each other, brought a climax, and the stream ended peacefully.">
