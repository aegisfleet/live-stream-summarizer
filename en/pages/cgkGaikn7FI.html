She struggles from the beginning, leading to long periods of silence. However, her occasional comments when she does make it into the top 3, and her expressions of frustration and impatience during her silent moments, are striking. The final race, where she finally achieves her goal of finishing in the top 3, becomes the ultimate highlight as she excitedly starts talking, as if releasing all her pent-up frustration. The broadcast highlighted the contrast between the struggle of the restrictive gameplay and the joy that came at the very end.">
