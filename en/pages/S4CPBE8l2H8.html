Immediately after the game started, their plane crashed, and they aimed for the summit while collecting supplies. Along the way, various obstacles appeared, such as poisonous thorns, mushrooms, and steep slopes. New threats like zombies and skeletons emerged, and there were moments when Riona was defeated. However, by using the &quot;Friendship Trumpet,&quot; Riona learned a gimmick that allowed her to become a ghost and fight enemies, enabling them to overcome powerful foes. After reaching the new stage &quot;Mesa,&quot; new dangers awaited the players, including scorpions, burning traps, and lava zones. Utilizing gimmicks at times and recovering stamina and hunger with items at others, the two overcame the harsh environment. In the final stage, &quot;Caldera,&quot; amidst erupting magma, they discovered a giant egg nest and proceeded to further adventures. The two eventually reached the final summit and were rescued by an escape helicopter, but a mishap occurred where Riona failed to escape, and only her soul was brought back. Finally, Riona also obtained a passport, filled with anticipation for a new journey.">
