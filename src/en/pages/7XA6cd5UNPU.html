After discovering a bonfire in the new area, the Profaned Capital, she returned to Firelink Shrine. She prepared for future challenges by leveling up, organizing items, and transposing a weapon from a boss soul. However, in a rematch against the Heralding Ghoul, which she thought she had previously defeated, and an intense battle against the new boss, the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, she struggled with their strength, suffering multiple defeats. Despite re-strategizing and adjusting Estus Flask distribution for the Dancer fight, she ran out of time and had to abandon the conquest for this session. The stream concluded with her expressing frustration, but also her determination for the next session and her growing interest in the story.">
