Challenging herself to play after a long time, she diligently performed fundamental exercises such as long tones, lip slurs, tonguing, and staccato. During breaks in practice, she covered a wide range of topics, from technical details like instrument structure and playing techniques, memories from her high school brass band club, introductions to various basic exercise books, to the difficulty of scale practice. Although she struggled with scale practice, which she particularly dislikes, she ultimately delivered a splendid performance of Sukima Switch&#039;s &#039;Kanade&#039;.

She explains that consistent breath support is vital.","timestamp":"00:11:30","type":"練習"},{"title":"Pitch Adjustment Demonstration","description":"She demonstrates raising and lowering pitch solely through lip vibrations.
