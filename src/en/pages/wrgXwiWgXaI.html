    <meta name="description" content="Roboco and guest Ririka were originally planning to make &#039;Extreme Ice Sweets&#039; as a summer festival challenge, but it was suddenly changed to making &#039;Extreme Yakisoba&#039;. While proceeding with cooking according to Chat GPT&#039;s instructions, frequent audio troubles occurred during the stream, leading to temporary silence. The cooking, which was pre-recorded, involved stir-frying sausages and cabbage, and due to Roboco&#039;s seasoning mistake, a salty yakisoba was completed. After that, they attempted to make rolled ice cream using sake and ramune, but the issue of alcohol&#039;s freezing point emerged. In an attempt to make rolled ice cream using tomato juice, Ririka took over because Roboco dislikes tomatoes, but it ended in failure. Despite mixing various ingredients, it was difficult to form rolls, and they successively tried new ingredients like frozen pudding and frozen bananas. Eventually, they rated the prototype with pudding and shaved chocolate as delicious. Afterward, they chatted about summer memories, pools, saunas, and body scrubs, reflected on their previous extreme sweets making, and concluded the collaborative stream by expressing gratitude to the viewers.">
