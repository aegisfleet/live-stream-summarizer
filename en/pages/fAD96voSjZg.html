In the mine, she completed a bone collection quest, and in the desert mine, she actively explored and gathered items, using bombs to acquire valuable resources like iridium ore and mystery boxes. She also reviewed her monster-slaying goals, and a mysterious explosion sound event occurred during the night, making for a jam-packed morning.

She continued to enjoy a fulfilling Stardew Valley life, performing farm tasks, organizing items, and discovering a secret room.
