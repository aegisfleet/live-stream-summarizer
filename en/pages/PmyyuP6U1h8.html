            highlights: [{"title":"Opening Greetings, Health Update, and Waking Up Due to Allergy Medication","description":"Oozora Subaru greets energetically with 'Ohasuba!' She mentions recently taking allergy medication but waking up after about 4 hours, leading to a slight lack of sleep. Blood test results revealed it was chronic rhinitis, not allergies.","timestamp":"00:03:08","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Late-Night Trouble Consultation Episode with Kanade","description":"Kanade consulted 'Suba-mama' late at night with her troubles, but as they talked, the conversation eventually turned into just sharing information about delicious sukiyaki restaurants. Subaru emphasized her great love for sukiyaki, stating she likes it even more than curry.","timestamp":"00:05:20","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Aki Rosenthal's Shocking Butt Bag","description":"Subaru talks about Aki Rosenthal's strange bag. She reveals the shocking fact that the bag is shaped like a butt, even reproducing the panty line. Subaru was initially confused, but was surprised when Aki herself explained, 'It's a butt,' and even showed her the deep panty line.","timestamp":"00:10:40","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Afternoon Tea & Shop Hopping with Flare","description":"Subaru talks about her afternoon tea date with Flare. Flare was adorable throughout, happily discussing stuffed animals and cosmetics. Subaru was surprised to learn it was only Flare's second visit, despite her and the staff chatting as if she were a regular. Afterwards, the two visited various shops and picked out many cute accessories.","timestamp":"00:18:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Girls' Night with Lui and Ichiran Debut","description":"Subaru held a girls' night at Lui's house. They tried to enjoy lit candles, but the air conditioner's strong breeze quickly extinguished them. Later, feeling hungry, they ate pre-packaged rice with furikake. Lui was fond of her Tamagotchi cover and had invited Okayu to 'have candles at Subaru's house.' On a later day, Subaru experienced Ichiran for the first time. She was nervous after hearing about Ichiran's many rules from Fubuki but was deeply moved by successfully finishing the delicious meal, praising, 'Ichiran is god-tier.'","timestamp":"00:27:55","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Details of Ichiran Debut: Restaurant Atmosphere and Ordering Difficulty","description":"Lui skillfully ordered at Ichiran, but Subaru was bewildered by the 'study room-like seats.' She said she was initially intimidated by the numerous rules posted inside the restaurant, known as 'flavor concentration counters,' such as 'Don't talk to your neighbor,' 'Don't wait for your companion,' and 'Served within 15 seconds.' She recounted being so nervous by the strictness that she broke her chopsticks while waiting.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Ichiran's Kaedama (Noodle Refill) BGM and 'Melody of Blessing'","description":"Ordering a noodle refill (kaedama) is done by placing a plate on the table, which triggers the 'flavor concentration counter' background music to alert staff. Subaru said this loud BGM initially felt eerie, but because the ramen was so delicious, it began to sound like a 'melody of blessing.' She even tried activating it herself.","timestamp":"00:44:50","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Deep Impression of Ichiran's Hidden Gem, 'Shikaibi Tea'","description":"Subaru had heard from Lui that 'the tea is good,' but upon trying it, she was deeply moved to discover it was 'Shikaibi Tea,' an Ichiran original. It was served chilled and was exceptionally delicious after the ramen. She claimed to be so impressed by this ramen experience that she forgot all her worries, passionately urging listeners, 'You guys, you have to order this tea!'","timestamp":"00:50:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Anniversary Stream Announcement and Gifts from Holomembers","description":"Regarding her anniversary stream, Subaru mentioned the possibility of streaming on the 15th as a pre-celebration and the 18th as a post-celebration, as her birthday and a live event fall on September 16th. She also talked about receiving various gifts from Holomembers. Korone gave her a Pokémon game, and Mikochi gave her a duck stamp, which she said resembled Subaru.","timestamp":"00:52:00","type":"お知らせ"},{"title":"Chat About Tamagotchi and Anime","description":"Prompted by Okanrin (Nekomata Okayu) starting Tamagotchi, Subaru talked about buying a new one herself. She passionately discussed the Tamagotchi 'fusion' system. She also mentioned recently watched anime and manga, including the zombie romance drama 'Happiness,' Black Clover, Mashle, The Prince of Tennis, Naruto, Kaiji, Baki, and Sakigake!! Otokojuku.","timestamp":"01:02:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Stream Conclusion and Thanks","description":"Subaru reflected on the week's events and expressed gratitude to her viewers. She re-announced that there would be a Naruto simultaneous viewing stream today from 7 PM JST and concluded in English, 'Thank you for watching! Next stream, today 1PM. NARUTO,' then ended the stream with a smile, saying, 'Well then, everyone, see you again. Bye-bye, Otsubaru!'","timestamp":"01:05:00","type":"トーク"}],
