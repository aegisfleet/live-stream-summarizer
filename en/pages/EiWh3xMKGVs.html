            highlights: [{"title":"Stream Start and Opening Talk","description":"Greetings at the start of the stream and a discussion about her appearance at the recent Hololive 6th Anniversary Live. She shares episodes from the live performance and interactions with other Holomembers during long waiting periods.","timestamp":"00:09:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Horror Game 'FORK ROAD' Begins","description":"Explanation of today's game, '丁字路/FORK ROAD'. She clarifies that it's '丁字路' (tee-junction) rather than 'T字路' (T-junction), and that it's a puzzle horror game. Before starting, she adjusts settings, lowering the volume and tweaking mouse sensitivity.","timestamp":"00:12:15","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"First Puzzle: Calculation Problem","description":"The game begins, and she proceeds down a spooky corridor. In the first room, she's presented with a calculation problem '1+8x7-9'. Kanata quickly answers '48' and gets it right. Afterwards, she encounters a scene where she's forced to make an absurd choice, and remarks, 'The game is getting angry at me.'","timestamp":"00:16:15","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Pumpkin Counting Puzzle","description":"In the next room, a large number of pumpkins appear, and she is instructed to count them. Kanata seriously counts them, even categorizing different types of pumpkins. When she answers '99' correctly, she is surprised by the sudden explosion of the pumpkins.","timestamp":"00:24:20","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Challenge of Smoking or Not","description":"When asked 'Do you smoke?', choosing 'No' causes the room to burst into flames. She retorts, 'That's weird, does that mean I'm smoking right now?!' While making that remark, choosing the correct answer, 'Yes', initiates a mini-game where she attacks an incoming pumpkin man with a pipe.","timestamp":"00:28:30","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Challenging the Laser Puzzle","description":"Next, she enters a stage where she has to avoid lasers. Initially confused during her first playthrough, she tries multiple times and eventually grasps the timing to avoid the lasers and break through. This stage, combined with the game's absurdity, brings out Kanata's sharp witty remarks.","timestamp":"00:39:50","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Re-challenge: 'What color are his eyes?'","description":"She re-challenges the puzzle 'What color are his eyes?', which she failed previously. She chooses brown and fails, being told to 'look more closely.' She approaches to check but sees nothing, eventually choosing brown again and failing. Immediately after, a big jumpscare occurs, and she shouts 'It's red!', realizing the option changed to 'red'.","timestamp":"00:40:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Question: 'Should pineapple be added to pizza?'","description":"In the next room, she's asked 'Should pineapple be added to pizza?'. Kanata is in the 'No' camp. Expecting to be attacked regardless of her choice, she selects 'No'. Then, a Pineapple Man (a pineapple version of the pumpkin man) appears and chases her. Unable to escape, she's attacked, resulting in a game over. She shouts, 'I was attacked by the pro-pineapple on pizza faction!' and expresses her regret.","timestamp":"00:41:13","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Question: 'Are you afraid of the dark?'","description":"Despite an instruction to 'Run!', she points out that she can't run due to the game system. When asked 'Should pineapple be added to pizza?' again, she chooses 'Yes', and the Pineapple Man appears, attacking her again and leading to a game over. Afterward, when asked 'Are you afraid of the dark?', she chooses 'Yes', and the room goes completely dark. Proceeding with almost zero visibility, a jumpscare occurs with a zombie appearing, resulting in another game over.","timestamp":"00:41:53","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Question: 'Is his mouth open?'","description":"When asked 'Is his mouth open?', Kanata looks carefully and answers 'Yes'. She gets it right, but immediately after, a zombie appears with a jumpscare, leading to a game over. She is further toyed with messages like 'Don't just stand there vaguely' and questions such as 'How many zombies have you seen?'","timestamp":"00:45:06","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Question: 'How many laughs have you heard?'","description":"When asked 'How many laughs have you heard?', she answers '6'. She gets it right, but immediately after, a jumpscare occurs. Furthermore, when asked 'How many questions have you passed so far?', she calculates and answers '15'. She gets it right, but another jumpscare occurs. She is touched by the words 'It's almost over. I already miss you,' but retorts, 'You're just going to make me turn back after all that, aren't you?'","timestamp":"00:46:58","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Investigating the Crime Scene","description":"She proceeds to a new room and receives instructions to 'investigate the crime scene'. She obtains a key placed on a desk in the center of the room. As soon as she picks up the key, a zombie appears from behind, and a jumpscare occurs simultaneously as she turns around.","timestamp":"00:50:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Which is your best friend?","description":"She is asked whether a dog or a cat is her best friend. Kanata, who prefers dogs, answers 'Dogs are my type because they're obedient' and chooses the dog. Immediately after, a jumpscare occurs with a visual of the dog and cat switching places. She exclaims 'So cute!' and fawns over the cat too. Furthermore, when asked 'Do you like this game?', she honestly answers 'Yes', but another jumpscare occurs. A message appears: 'You are too naive and easily deceived.'","timestamp":"00:52:50","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Question: 'Make the most terrifying choice.'","description":"When asked 'Make the most terrifying choice,' she selects left, and a zombie appears and attacks her. Furthermore, when asked 'Have you forgotten this is a horror game?', she answers 'Yes', and a jumpscare occurs right in front of her. She screams 'Waaahhhhhh!'","timestamp":"00:57:28","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Game Clear!","description":"When asked 'Do you love this game?', she again honestly answers 'Yes'. This time, a jumpscare occurs from behind. She screams 'Wah!', and gets a game over, but then the screen changes to a bright sky with the words 'Congratulations'. She simultaneously achieved both the standard and hidden endings, successfully clearing the game! She retorts, 'What kind of ending is this?!'","timestamp":"01:02:40","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Post-Game Impressions and Summary","description":"As a summary after clearing the game, she reflects that despite its absurdity, it was 'playful' and 'cute', and she grew fond of it.","timestamp":"01:20:00","type":"トーク"},{"title":"A Moment Right Before an Information Leak","description":"She attempts to mention tomorrow's stream schedule, but almost reveals the content, hastily saying 'I shouldn't say this' and avoiding an information leak.","timestamp":"01:21:00","type":"リアクション"},{"title":"Closing Greetings and Post-Meal Confession","description":"She greets viewers with 'Otsu Kanata' and confesses that she ate three ice creams during the stream and her stomach is full.","timestamp":"01:21:22","type":"トーク"}],
