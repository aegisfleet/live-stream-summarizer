    <meta name="description" content="This is a cover song video (&quot;Utattemita&quot;) by Shirakami Fubuki of the song &quot;Omagatoki no Kaerikata&quot; by Hiiragi Kirai. It distinctively features the interplay between &quot;Kurokami Fubuki&quot; (Black Fubuki) and &quot;Shirakami Fubuki&quot; (White Fubuki), representing her duality. The high-quality animated PV depicts a dramatic scenario set in a dark and aesthetic world, where the seemingly fallen Kurokami Fubuki tempts the lonely and suffering Shirakami Fubuki into hell. The high energy, rock tune, and the conversational style of the duet are highly appealing.">
