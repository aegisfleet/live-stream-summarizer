Early in the stream, she revealed that her mouse&#039;s double-clicking issue was getting severe and mentioned plans to buy a new one. She then discussed an Indonesian spicy food guide displayed on her screen. Following this, she enthusiastically talked about her recent start in Pilates, focusing on health maintenance and improvement in her back pain. In the middle section, branching from the topic of exercise, she began training a horse girl in &#039;Uma Musume Pretty Derby&#039; as motivation for working out. Simultaneously, she praised the excellent translation features of the Hololive fan app &#039;Holoplus&#039; and attempted a chaotic collaborative fan fiction relay post with her fans. This fan fiction, centered around El Condor Pasa and Kobo Kanaeru, became a highlight of the stream due to the abnormal inclusion of &#039;feet/hoof&#039; elements, which Reine narrated while laughing hysterically at the chaotic development. Towards the end, after completing the Uma Musume training, she considered playing the &#039;Ace Attorney&#039; series next, following enthusiastic recommendations from fans.
