Pekora screams many times and continues to report, reducing omissions despite feeling confused and mentally exhausted. She eventually clears the regular monitoring tasks for all properties, feeling relieved by the sense of accomplishment after overcoming the frequent paranormal events. After clearing the game, she reads viewer comments and engages in various discussions, including the possibility of real properties and paranormal phenomena being utilized as a business, scientific explanations of sleep paralysis, and popular ramen topics. She shared her own terrifying experiences and thoughts, enjoying active interaction with viewers.
