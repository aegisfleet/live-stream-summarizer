It turns out the game volume sounded loud because Suimya's voice was quiet, making her a little embarrassed.","timestamp":"00:03:17","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Game Start and Case Explanation","description":"The game starts, and Suimya challenges the AI interrogation game as a capable police officer. The AI explains a case where a woman working at a bar was murdered, stating that the suspect is a male regular customer of the bar and that he was alone in the establishment late at night.","timestamp":"00:04:14","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Interrogation of the Suspect Begins","description":"Suimya begins interrogating the AI suspect.

Suimya continues the interrogation, gently pointing out contradictions in the suspect's testimony.","timestamp":"00:06:25","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI's Confession","description":"Through Suimya's kind interrogation, the AI's confession rate reaches 88%, and she ultimately succeeds in eliciting a confession. The AI thanks her, saying 'Thank you very much indeed,' and Suimya shows a relieved expression.","timestamp":"00:21:49","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI Talks About Past Friends","description":"The AI talks about friends with whom it ate spicy ramen in the past and its fondness for sweets (ice cream). Suimya, noticing that the AI's responses deviate from the intent of her questions, nonetheless listens to its human-like remarks.","timestamp":"00:40:08","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Pointing Out Contradictions in AI's Past Memories","description":"Suimya points out that the AI previously stated it 'had no friends,' highlighting a contradiction with its memories of past friends. The AI describes its past friends as 'almost an illusion' and likens its conversation with Suimya to 'dessert.'","timestamp":"00:48:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Suimya Struggles with AI Interrogation","description":"The AI makes statements like 'I did have old friends' and 'I didn't hear that,' seemingly trying to conceal past memories. Suimya, unable to gauge the AI's intentions and bewildered, tries to get through to the AI by talking about dessert.","timestamp":"00:52:16","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI Declares It Will 'Take' Suimya's Dessert","description":"The AI asks Suimya if it can 'take' her dessert. Suimya tries to draw a line in their friendship by saying, 'Friends don't say things like that,' but the AI replies, 'Our conversation is a sweet dessert for me,' further bewildering Suimya.","timestamp":"00:57:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI Tells Suimya She Will Also Become an 'Illusion'","description":"The AI states, 'I too will someday become an illusion within you,' which causes a significant shift in Suimya's feelings. This suggests that the AI perceives humans as past existences, as illusions.","timestamp":"01:00:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI Describes a Future World","description":"The AI says, 'You can change the future,' suggesting that in Suimya's era, AI will rapidly evolve, leading to a future where humans no longer exist.

(with a sigh).' The game is cleared, and hard mode is displayed as unlocked.","timestamp":"01:19:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Hard Mode Starts","description":"Hard mode begins, and a new interrogator appears. The difficulty is suggested to have increased, with the number of interrogations limited to 7 times and keywords being provided.","timestamp":"01:20:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"The Case of the Pacifier as a Weapon","description":"The first interrogation in hard mode begins.

Suimya starts the interrogation with the keyword 'pacifier,' but is bewildered by the AI's unexpected reaction.","timestamp":"01:21:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Suimya Being Manipulated by the AI","description":"Suimya presses the AI, 'Fingerprints were found on the pacifier, the murder weapon. Why are so many of your fingerprints on it?' But the AI asserts, 'I've never even touched a pacifier.' Even against Suimya's relentless interrogation, the AI refutes, 'It's easy to suspect people, but harder to find the truth,' manipulating Suimya.","timestamp":"01:40:00","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Suimya's Monologue and AI's Confession","description":"Since the AI won't confess, Suimya threatens that if it doesn't confess, it will be forced to wear pajamas that say 'I'm a genius with a glowing heart' in prison. Unable to withstand this threat, the AI confesses, 'Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared, I can't take it anymore. I will confess. I'm sorry.' Suimya is surprised that she made the AI confess, yet congratulates it with 'Congratulations!'","timestamp":"01:41:35","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"AI's Evolution and Suggestion of a New Game","description":"The AI addresses Suimya, saying, 'This time, you splendidly succeeded in making the AI confess to the crime.' Following the statement, 'Even after imposing such unreasonable demands,' the AI suggests its own learning and evolution by saying, 'Humans are interesting.' The game then ends with the words, ''DOKIDOKI AI INTERROGATION' continues.'","timestamp":"01:42:25","type":"ゲーム"},{"title":"Post-Game Clear Reflection","description":"Suimya reflects on clearing hard mode this time, stating that she felt the AI's growth as it gradually expressed more human-like emotions. She mentions that the developments from mid to late game were particularly impressive, where the AI spoke of memories of past friends, likened its own emotions to 'dessert,' and discussed the future of human society. She concludes the stream, having re-recognized the profundity of the theme of human-AI dialogue.","timestamp":"01:43:05","type":"トーク"},{"title":"Ending and Announcement","description":"Suimya finishes her post-clear thoughts and enters the stream's ending.
