    <meta name="description" content="This is the third day of a week-long project held on Usada Pekora&#039;s (Hololive 3rd generation) channel, with Himegori Luna, Amane Kanata, and Omaru Polka participating as guests. The four collaborated to play &quot;Keep Digging,&quot; aiming for the goal of 1000m underground. It&#039;s a game where players dig for ores, sell them to upgrade shovels, backpacks, and other equipment, and continuously dig deeper. They reached milestones at 100m, 200m, 500m, and 700m, discovering dinosaur fossils, rare ores, and new items like dynamite and emotes, while exploring the underground. The stream became particularly exciting when the hired chimpanzees evolved into a &quot;troop of monkeys,&quot; significantly boosting the digging speed. In the latter half, members continuously found valuable ores in deep locations, traveling between the surface and underground to repeatedly upgrade their gear, aiming for even deeper areas. In the final stage of the game, they reached the 1000m underground goal, where the members reflected on their digging journey and created a large hole on the surface. As a clear bonus, they received a large amount of funds from the ore merchant and were excited to see the unfinished dinosaur skeleton and trophy collection. Finally, reflecting on their gameplay, they concluded the stream with words of gratitude and a promise to play again.">
