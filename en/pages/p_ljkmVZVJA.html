    <meta name="description" content="A Super Donkey Kong parallel playthrough battle featuring Yukihana Lamy and Momosuzu Nene. Both were playing for the very first time, and while they struggled with the basic controls and gimmicks, they cooperated to clear the stages. Especially in the early Barrel Cannon Canyon and underwater stages, there were many instances of game over, filled with screams and laughter, resulting in a consistently lively and chaotic development. They particularly struggled in Barrel Cannon Canyon&#039;s bee area and Monkey Mines&#039; minecart stages, repeatedly getting game overs. However, they eventually defeated Boss Naughty, with Lamy clearing World 1 and 2, and Nene clearing 3 stages of World 1, securing Lamy&#039;s victory. It turned out to be an intense parallel playthrough battle full of mishaps until the very end.">
