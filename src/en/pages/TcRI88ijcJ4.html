    <meta name="description" content="This is a reading stream by Hololive&#039;s Natsuiro Matsuri of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#039;s short story, &quot;The Spider&#039;s Thread&quot; (Kumo no Ito). As her first reading stream, she narrates the story in a quiet and calming atmosphere. It tells the tale of Kandata, a great thief who fell into Hell, attempting to climb the spider&#039;s thread offered by Buddha due to one good deed in his past. The story, which depicts human ego and karma, is told in a gentle and soothing voice. The thread snaps the moment Kandata tries to exclude the other sinners, sending him back to Hell. Since it is short (about 13 minutes), it is suitable for winding down or as a sleep aid before bed.">
