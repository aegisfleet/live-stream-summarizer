    <meta name="description" content="Momosuzu Nene&#039;s free talk stream. It began with a mishap where a Hi-Chew got stuck in her throat, then she talked about her 5th-anniversary merchandise and Hololive advertisements in Shibuya. Topics included her fabric softener and perfume, and the popular song &quot;Hage no Uta&quot; (Song of Baldness) brought much excitement. There was also a comical moment where she expressed surprise at Laplace Darkness&#039;s comment and tried to draw viewer comments. In the middle, she delved into occult and sci-fi discussions, including horror-themed Thomas the Tank Engine, dreams, urban legends, wizards, and the existence of dinosaurs. She noted the AI&#039;s learning ability when the term &quot;unicorn&quot; was used as a unique term among VTuber fans. The latter half progressed from discussing the Gintama 4DX movie to a fetish talk about imagining character scents. She got excited over nostalgic BakaTest novels, joked about the evolution of otaku culture and Yagoo&#039;s dream novels, enjoying fan interaction in a consistently cheerful atmosphere throughout the stream.">
