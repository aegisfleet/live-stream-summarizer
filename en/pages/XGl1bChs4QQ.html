    <meta name="description" content="A stream where AZKi challenges the train driver simulation game &#039;TRAIN CREW&#039; again, aiming to become a train driver. Last time, she perfectly handled conductor duties, and this time she attempts driving operations. However, being unfamiliar with driving, she struggles with stopping positions at stations, departure/arrival announcements, and signal checks, repeatedly making mistakes. She frequently forgets announcements, showing signs of panic, saying &quot;too early&quot; and &quot;difficult timing.&quot; She operates the train through various sceneries, including mountainous areas, underground sections, and coastal views, experiencing the difficulty and depth of driving operations. In the final performance evaluation, she achieves 100% for on-time operation, door handling, and signal checks, but is penalized for in-car announcements and other operations, resulting in a 90% evaluation. In this driving operation, while improvements in brake control and adherence to signal checks shone, she still struggled with adjusting stopping positions, leading to an overall evaluation of 85.7%. In the latter half of the stream, she deeply learned about railway signals and ATS at the &#039;training center&#039; and reconfirmed the basic procedures for driving operations. There were also announcements for Hololive&#039;s summer event &#039;Holohanabi&#039; (Hololive Fireworks) and its emotional experience, the upcoming &#039;Hololive Generation G&#039; collaboration, and the &#039;AZKi 5th Anniversary Live Departure&#039; concert. During the super chat reading at the end, her interest in railways deepened with discussions about Tokyo&#039;s complex stations and the Haneda Airport Access Line, and she was impressed by valuable advice from a former train driver.
