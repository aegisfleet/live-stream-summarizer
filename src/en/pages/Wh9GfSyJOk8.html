    <meta name="description" content="This is a stream of the horror/suspense game &#039;s.p.l.i.t&#039; by Anya Melfissa of hololive ID. The player acts as an ethical hacker, attempting to hack into a system. Continuing from the previous session, Anya struggles with accessing system configuration files and manipulating files as instructed via IRC chat. She discovers a strange document about &#039;torture presets&#039; within the game, leading to her adorable reactions and laughter at its absurd content. Furthermore, she downloads mysterious files from other characters and checks prisoner lists and system logs. After trial and error using an authentication tool, she finally succeeds in generating an authentication key and gaining root access to the system. However, at the same time, she is pursued by enemies. In a desperate situation, she is forced to make the ultimate choice between brain destruction or suicide, ultimately reaching an ending where her brain is destroyed. The game&#039;s conclusion is heavy, depicting the abyss and cruelty of hacking. In the latter half of the stream, the discussion focuses on reflections about the game&#039;s ending and future streaming plans (such as Lost in Random and Little Nightmares 2).
