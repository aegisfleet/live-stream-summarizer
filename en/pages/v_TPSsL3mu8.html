    <meta name="description" content="A collaborative stream of &#039;Goblin Cleanup&#039; featuring four Hololive members, transitioning from the latter half of the main dungeon &quot;THE ENTRANCE&quot; to the strategy session for &quot;THE LIBRARY.&quot; The members repeatedly fell victim to mimics, splattering blood everywhere, yet cooperated to repair objects and clean up. The Library area presented high-difficulty traps, including spears triggered by floor switches, attacks from statues activated by running, and giant rotating blade traps. Despite numerous deaths, they managed to divide the tasks of solving puzzles and disarming traps, successfully clearing the Level 2 objectives. Finally, they received rewards and tried on new costumes, such as maid outfits, concluding the stream.">
