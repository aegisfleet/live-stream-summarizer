Despite having only played Shadowverse for 10 days, she challenged ranked matches in preparation for the CR Cup main event scheduled for tomorrow. At the beginning of the stream, she comically restarted her greeting after realizing she was muted. In her first match, using a Haven deck (Guardian Bishop), she engaged in intense back-and-forth combat, struggling against the opponent&#039;s fierce attacks but diligently trying to rebuild her board. However, she ultimately lost due to not knowing the deck-out rule. She also struggled and lost in the subsequent Nemesis match due to powerful combos, but she continued to challenge ranked matches with renewed spirit. At times, she showed great excitement for dramatic victories, and at other times, she struggled in long, drawn-out battles, all while deepening her interaction with viewers through serious yet humorous reactions. In the Royal match, despite having very low health, her tenacious fight using Ward followers and board-clearing cards against the opponent&#039;s relentless assault was particularly memorable. Overall, it was a stream where she actively communicated with viewers, sharing the depth of the game and her own growth.">
